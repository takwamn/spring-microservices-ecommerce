# Spring Microservices E-commerce System

This project implements a microservices-based e-commerce system using Spring Boot. The system consists of several services, each with its own specific responsibilities.

## Services

1. **Product Service**:
   - Manages the creation and retrieval of products.
   - Acts as a product catalog, providing information about available products.

2. **Order Service**:
   - Handles the ordering process, allowing users to place orders for products.
   - Interacts with the Product Service to retrieve information about products being ordered.

3. **Inventory Service**:
   - Manages inventory levels for products.
   - Provides functionality to check whether a product is in stock or not.
   - May interact with the Order Service to update inventory levels after an order is placed.

4. **Notification Service**:
   - Sends notifications to users after orders are placed.
   - Receives order information from the Order Service and triggers notifications accordingly.

## Additional Considerations

- **Data Consistency**: Ensure consistency across services, especially during transactions.
  
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Implement mechanisms for service discovery and load balancing.

- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure communication between services.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging solutions to track the performance and health of each service.

- **Fault Tolerance and Resilience**: Design the system with resilience in mind, implementing retry mechanisms and circuit breakers.
